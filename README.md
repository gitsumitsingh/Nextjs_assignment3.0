This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## NextJS Assignment 3.0

- 1. Create a Next Js application which demonstrate data fetching by using ServerActions as well as try to perform mutations. take care of data caching and re validating.
- [done] https://github.com/gitsumitsingh/Nextjs_assignment3.0

- 2. Explain in details what are the advantages of ServerActions and Revalidating the data?
- As per my knowledge, nextjs provides a great feature in ServerActions to submit form data to server or db using fetch api and can load data/refesh without page load.
- In Revaladiting, we need to set a time for next js fetch api to fetch latest data on time interval.
